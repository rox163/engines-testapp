# ember-cli-mocha

Mocha / Chai testing for your Ember CLI apps.

## Installation

Install ember-cli-mocha:

```sh
ember install ember-cli-mocha
```

## Usage

ember-cli-mocha overrides all of ember-cli's testing blueprints. Simply generate
models, controllers, components, etc. in order to generate the corresponding Mocha
/ Chai tests.

Tests rely on [ember-mocha](https://github.com/switchfly/ember-mocha) modules
and helpers. Please refer to that project to understand detailed usage.

## Turning off JSHint linting

If you want to turn off JSHint linting you can do the following configuration in your ember-cli-build.js file:

```
var app = new EmberApp({
  'babel': {
    optional: ['es7.decorators']
  },

  'ember-cli-mocha': {
    useLintTree: false
  }
});
```
